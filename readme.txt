Key: *** means I feel this project is one of the more interesting pieces of code I have.

DriverClass.java: Exploring Java's class system and inheritance, as well as object instantiation.
Login.php: Modification of some sample code, but my first API endpoint file I have produced.
PythonDataAnalysis.ipynb: An assignent for one of my classes demonstrating basic knowledge over some of the libraries Python has to offer.
TriePrediction.c: Predicting possible words in a string based on previously inputted data. Incorporates the data structure Trie.
***StringMuncher.c: Creating a new, arbitrary data structure called StringMuncher, which essentially overcomplicates the process of storing and modifying/manipulating strings within C.
jumpinggame.java: Basic practice of navigating data using permutations within Java.
***pl0compiler.c: One of the more substantial projects so far. Co-authored a compiler for the language PL/0, a basic assembly language for educational purposes.
